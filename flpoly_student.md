# Introduction to Data Science
I've learned how to:

- Format text and input hyperlinks and images

- Create vectors and use values with variables 

- Pull and clone an existing repository, make changes, then push and commit those changes back to the repository

[Link on Vectors](https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/vector/)

**Hobbies:**

I am _passionate about_: 

- Pets, which I myself, favor dogs and cats

- Action, Adventure, Strategy Videogames along with Boardgames

- Using coding platforms to advance my skills: https://www.unlock.academy/, https://www.codecademy.com/ along with languages of HTML, CSS, and Python

```{r}
my_name <- c("Kylil","Williams")
name_length <- length(my_name)
print(name_length)

e <- 2.71828
e^pi > pi^e

add_tree <- 9
mult <- (add_tree*3)
print(mult)

v10_49 <- (10:49)
v10_49length <- length(v10_49)
print(v10_49length)

increment <- seq(-5, 10, by=0.5)
print(increment)
```
